# Create: Mobile Packages
A Minecraft mod that adds support for delivering Create Mod Packages directly to the player.

## Requirements
- Forge 47.4.0 or newer
- Create 6.0.4 or newer

## Items
### Drone Port
The Drone Port is a specialized block that automates the delivery of Create mod Packages to players. When a Package is put inside (using, for example, a Funnel, Chute, or Hopper), the station reads the address label on the package and delivers its contents directly to the player whose name matches the address.

### Drone Controller
The Drone Controller is a handheld device that integrates with a Create mod network, allowing players to request packages remotely. Once linked to a stock ticker, it provides a Stockkeeper interface, enabling players to request items on the go without needing direct access to a Stockkeeper.
